# Generate simulated data
This folder contains implementation to simulates data from cognive computaional models: 4-P RL, HRL, and GLM-HMM

Data simulated from other public open source code: 
- Meta RL with dyanmic noise: please use the open source [code](https://github.com/jl3676/dynamic_noise_estimation/tree/main/Dynamic_Foraging/code) from [Li et.al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2024.102842)
- Weber-imprecision: please use the open source [code] under `simulation_functions/noisy_forward`
 folder (https://github.com/csmfindling/learning_variability_and_volatility/blob/master/simulation_functions/noisy_forward/smc2.py) from [Findling et.al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-00971-z)
