# Generate simulated data
This folder contains implementation to simulates data from cognive computaional models: 4-P RL, HRL, and GLM-HMM

To simulate data from meta RL with dyanmic noise, we use the open source [code](https://github.com/jl3676/dynamic_noise_estimation/tree/main/Dynamic_Foraging/code) from [Li et.al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2024.102842)
