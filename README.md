# Latent Variable Sequence Identification for Cognitive Models with Neural Bayes Estimation

This repository is the official implementation of LaseNet: Latent Variable Sequence Identification for Cognitive Models with Neural Bayes Estimation
<!-- add a paper link optional.  -->


## Requirements

To install requirements, first create a conda environment from the environment yaml file by running

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate this environment by running
```
conda activate lasenet
```

## Training
- Generate simulation data by running the notebook `simulation/simulate.ipynb`. The generated data will be saved to `data` folder. We also include sample data in `zip` file for Meta RL and GLM-HMM models.
- Train the LastNet by running the notebook `training.ipynb`. The notebook shows how we train and fine-tune LaseNet for differet computational cognitive models. The generated model will be saved to `results` folder.


## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).
